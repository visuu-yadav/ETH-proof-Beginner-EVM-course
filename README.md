# ETH-proof-Beginner-EVM-course
We are utilizing solidity to develop our project.

# DESCRIPTION
In this project, we will utilize functions like "mint" and "burn" alongside others to execute the code.

# HOW TO GET STARTED
# INSTALLING
The code executes the Online Remix IDE, an internet-based platform. It allows us to publish our code directly or establish a new repository on GitHub and generate a new file within it.

# EXECUTING PROGRAM
Once the code is finished on an online remix IDE, there is an option to compile the program. After compiling the code, we need to deploy it and test the functionality of the functions utilized in our code.
