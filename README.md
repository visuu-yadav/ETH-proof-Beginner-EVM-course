## Overview

The `MyToken` contract provides a simple implementation of a token with the ability to mint and burn tokens. We can mint new tokens and increase their balances, as well as burn tokens to reduce the total supply and balances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum development environment (such as Remix or Truffle).
- An Ethereum wallet to deploy the contract (e.g., MetaMask).

### Deployment

1. Copy the contract code from [`MyToken.sol`](MyToken.sol) to your Ethereum development environment.

2. Deploy the contract using your preferred development environment.

## Usage

### Minting Tokens

To mint new tokens and assign them to an address, call the `mint` function:

```solidity
function mint(address _address, uint256 _value) public {
    // ... (Minting logic)
}
```

Replace `_address` with the recipient's Ethereum address and `_value` with the amount of tokens to mint.

### Burning Tokens

To burn existing tokens, reducing the total supply and the balance of an address, call the `burn` function:

```solidity
function burn(address _address, uint256 _value) public {
    // ... (Burning logic)
}
```

Replace `_address` with the address from which tokens will be burned and `_value` with the amount of tokens to burn.

## Contract Details

### Token Name

The name of the token is `"VISHAL"`. You can customize the token name to your preference.

### Token Abbreviation

The token abbreviation is `"VISH"`. This abbreviation represents the token's symbol.

### Total Supply

The initial total supply of tokens is set to `0`. You can increase the total supply by minting new tokens.
